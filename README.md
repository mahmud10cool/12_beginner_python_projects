# Beginner Python Projects
I am doing this to enhance my python skills
Also my coding typing skills
Also to learn more about git

Originally this was supposed to be the 12 python projects shown in the freecodecamp YouTube channel.
But now I am expanding it to whatever Python projects I am doing at the beginner level.
Any ROS related project will NOT be uploaded here.
