## Introduction

# I would like to get started in the name of God.
# Bless me God, I need your help to understand all of these things.
# Pleaj help!!!

# Let me get started
# Apparently this book will help me learn python quickly
# Let us see
# Many have tried and many have failed

# In Chapter 1 you’ll install Python on your computer and run your first
# program, which prints the message Hello world! to the screen.
# In Chapter 2 you’ll learn to assign information to variables and work
# with text and numerical values.
# Chapters 3 and 4 introduce lists. Lists can store as much information as
# you want in one place, allowing you to work with that data efficiently. You’ll
# be able to work with hundreds, thousands, and even millions of values in
# just a few lines of code.
# In Chapter 5 you’ll use if statements to write code that responds one
# way if certain conditions are true, and responds in a different way if those
# conditions are not true.
# Chapter 6 shows you how to use Python’s dictionaries, which let you
# make connections between different pieces of information. Like lists, dic-
# tionaries can contain as much information as you need to store.
# In Chapter 7 you’ll learn how to accept input from users to make your
# programs interactive. You’ll also learn about while loops, which run blocks
# of code repeatedly as long as certain conditions remain true.
# In Chapter 8 you’ll write functions, which are named blocks of code
# that perform a specific task and can be run whenever you need them.
# Chapter 9 introduces classes, which allow you to model real-world
# objects. You’ll write code that represents dogs, cats, people, cars, rockets,
# and more.Chapter 10 shows you how to work with files and handle errors so your
# programs won’t crash unexpectedly. You’ll store data before your program
# closes and read the data back in when the program runs again. You’ll learn
# about Python’s exceptions, which allow you to anticipate errors and make
# your programs handle those errors gracefully.
# In Chapter 11 you’ll learn to write tests for your code, to check that
# your programs work the way you intend them to. As a result, you’ll be able
# to expand your programs without worrying about introducing new bugs.
# Testing your code is one of the first skills that will help you transition from
# beginner to intermediate programmer.
